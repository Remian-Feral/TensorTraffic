# TensorTraffic

This is my first personal project, and a continuation from my thesis paper. The project is uses reinforcement learning to handle simulated traffic. It may not seem much and forgive me for inexperience (since machine learning isn't taught here), but I'm open to suggestions in improving it. Eventhough I'm new to machine learning intend this project to a training ground for me and beginners alike to play around.

I used SUMO Traffic Simulator 1.9.1, Python 3.7.11, Pytorch 1.10.2 Gym 0.19.0, Stable Baselines 3 version 1.4.0, Pycharm 2021.1.2 (Community Edition), and Anacond 3 as the virtual env.
